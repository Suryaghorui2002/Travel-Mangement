Authentication: email/password and (optionally) OAuth (Google/Facebook).
Booking workflow with availability checks and price breakdowns.
Image uploads for destinations and tours.
Responsive and accessible UI.
REST API integration (or GraphQL) for backend services.
Tech stack

Quick start (development)
Clone the repo:
bash git clone https://github.com//Travel_Mangement-main cd tourism-management-app

Install dependencies:
bash npm install

or
yarn

Create a .env file in the project root and add required environment variables (example below).

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...

Note: Never commit secrets to version control. Use GitHub Actions / environment variables on hosting provider for CI/CD.

Backend (suggestion)
You can pair the frontend with a backend built using:

Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose)
OR Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (Prisma)
OR Django / Rails with REST API
API should expose endpoints for: destinations, tours, bookings, users, reviews, images.

Authentication & Payments
Use JWT for session handling, store tokens in httpOnly cookies where possible.
For payments, integrate Stripe Checkout or Stripe Payment Intents (server-side secret required).
Image uploads
Options:

Upload to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) from frontend or via backend upload endpoints.
Store only image URLs in the database.
Deployment
Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting provider (build static files and point frontend env vars to the API).
Backend: Heroku, Railway, Render, AWS, DigitalOcean App Platform.
Continuous deployment is recommended via GitHub Actions.

Tests
Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
End-to-end: Cypress or Playwright
Accessibility
Follow WCAG best practices: semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes where necessary, and color contrast checks.
